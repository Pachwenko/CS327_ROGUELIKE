Assignment 1.03 Based upon Professor Schaeffer's 1.02 solution code.

First output is the dungeon which is loaded in memory (save, load, seed switches all functional).
Second output is the distance map for non-tunneling monsters.
Third output is the distance map for tunneling monsters.
X in the distance maps represents a value of infinity (INT32_MAX / 10). All other values are displayed % 10.

99% of my code is in distmap.c and distmap.h. Only one function is visible to rlg327.c.
