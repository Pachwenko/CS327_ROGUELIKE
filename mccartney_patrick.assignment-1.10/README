Builds off Schaeffer's 1.09 solution.

Implements ranged combat. In order to test this I provide a modified object_descriptions.txt in the descriptions folder.
Only works if you have a ranged weapon equipped (index 2, slot 'c'). A melee weapon is also provided in descriptions to test this.

Note that sometimes the game crashes, but when ran with valgrind the crash does not happen...
