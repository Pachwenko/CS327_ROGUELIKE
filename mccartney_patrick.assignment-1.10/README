Builds off Schaeffer's 1.09 solution.

Only works if you have a ranged weapon equipped (index 2, slot 'c').
A melee weapon is also provided in descriptions to test this.
Note that sometimes the game crashes, but when ran with valgrind the crash does not happen...

Press 'r' to attack with a ranged weapon equipped.
Press 'R' to attack previous target (if none available, enters normal targeting as if you press 'r' instead).

Press 'z' to throw a poison bomb (similar to 'z' but uses mana instead of a ranged weapon);

Has updated UI to display player health and mana instead of PC position.

Implements ranged combat. In order to test this I provide a modified object_descriptions.txt in the descriptions folder.
